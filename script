- chopsticks can be played with many rulesets. the key rule variations include:
--- when your hand is 'out'
--- whether you can split fingers across hands
--- whether you can attack yourself and if you can intentionally get rid of one of your hands
-- and these variations can create a lot of different rule permutations (under variations)

there are also interesting properties that the wikipedia apeg claims, for instance
- impossible hand positions
- longest possible games

we made a model that is extensible on
- the number of teams
- the number of hands per team
- the rulesets that you can initialize your game with
